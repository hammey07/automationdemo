Summary 
These automation test cases are for http://automationpractice.com/.
I decided to stick with one out of many testing scenarios. In my opinion, below are the important features that I tested during this automation. 
1-	Search Bar
2-	Product title validation
3-	Price validation
4-	User Details validation
These features have been tested from initial product search to final checkout. I would invest my time adding the following features at a later stage.
1-	Allow multi browser support.
2-	Allow tests to run independently.
